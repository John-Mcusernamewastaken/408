- The agents/algorithms are defined in agents.py, environment code is in environments.py.
- Remember to install the requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt).

- Running train.py will train new agents.
    - This typically takes a very long time.
    - The final weights of the agents are written to disk in /checkpoints
    - Training metrics are written to disk in /metrics. Re-plot a metrics file using plot.py (change the file path on line 5).
    - Ensure that the constants are set correctly.
- File beginning with demo_ can be used to observe the AI agents playing the game directly.
    - Instantiate the correct agent type & layer structure.
    - The pre-trained agent weights use: hiddenLayers=[layers.Flatten(), layers.Dense(16, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid)] //TODO if you're reading this I forgot to include them/update this part
    - Ensure that the correct weight file is loaded (change the file path).
- Files beginning with human_interactive can be used to play the games directly.
    - Maze: Move using the arrow keys. Collect as many coins as possible.
    - Tag: Turn using left & right arrow keys. Try to avoid the red blob as long as possible.
    - Tic-Tac-Toe: Click a cell to place your symbol.
